The agent registration page serves as a central control for agent data management, allowing users to perform actions such as creating, viewing details, editing, and deleting agent data. It facilitates efficient management and maintenance of agent information for users.


## üßë Password Validation Function

This program includes a password validation function that checks whether a given string meets the following requirements:

1. Minimum length of 8 characters.
2. Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
3. Does not contain any special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $).
4. The function returns True if the password is valid and False otherwise.

```sh
password = "MyPassword123"
  if validate_password(password):
     print("Password is valid.")
  else:
     print("Password is invalid.")
```

   <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/AriWiraSaputra/.netProgram/blob/main/img/Hasil%20Python.png" >
    </p>

To use the password validation function, call it and pass the password string as an argument. The function will then return the result indicating whether the password is valid or not.

## ‚ú® Two Sum Function

This program includes a two-sum function that takes an array of integers and a target number as input. It returns the indices of two elements in the array that, when summed, equal the target number. If no such pair of elements exists, the function returns None.

To use the two-sum function, call it and pass the array and target number as arguments. The function will then return the indices of the two elements that satisfy the condition or None if no such pair exists.

Example usage:

```sh
   nums = [2,2]
   target = 4
   result = two_sum(nums, target)
     if result is not None:
        index1, index2 = result
           print(f"The indices of the two elements are: {index1} and {index2}.")
     else:
           print("No pair of elements sum up to the target.")
```
